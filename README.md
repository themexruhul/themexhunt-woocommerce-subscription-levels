Plugin Name: Themexhunt WooCommerce Subscription Levels
Description: 
This plugin provides an advanced subscription-based reward system for WooCommerce. It allows store owners to create custom subscription tiers, reward customers with points based on their purchases, and offer discounts or free items based on earned points. The plugin is designed to enhance customer engagement and loyalty by offering personalized rewards and incentives.

**Key Features:**

1. **Custom Subscription Tiers:**
   - Create multiple subscription levels with custom names.
   - Assign unique discount percentages to each tier.
   - Select specific products eligible for discounts for each tier.

2. **Points System:**
   - Define custom points-to-dollars conversion rates (e.g., 5 points for $3).
   - Automatically add points to customers' accounts when they complete an order.
   - Fully supports orders with "Cash on Delivery" payment methods.

3. **Level Points Threshold:**
   - Set a points threshold for each subscription tier, allowing customers to level up when they reach the required points.

4. **Redeem Points for Free Items:**
   - Allow customers to use their points to claim free items.
   - Define the number of points required for redemption.

5. **Frontend Display:**
   - Display customers' current points and subscription levels on the "My Account" page.
   - Notify customers when they have enough points to redeem free items.

6. **Admin Management:**
   - Manage subscription tiers, discount percentages, and product eligibility in the WordPress admin settings.
   - View and edit customers' points and subscription levels in the user edit section of the WordPress admin.
   - Automatically update customers' subscription levels based on their earned points.

7. **Order Integration:**
   - Automatically calculate and add points for completed orders.
   - Handle points adjustments for refunded or canceled orders.

**How It Works:**
- Customers earn points for every dollar they spend (customizable in the settings).
- When a customer earns enough points, they are automatically upgraded to the next subscription level.
- Customers enjoy discounts on eligible products based on their subscription level.
- Customers can redeem their points for free items if they meet the redemption criteria.

This plugin is ideal for WooCommerce store owners who want to implement a robust loyalty and subscription system to boost customer retention and increase sales.
